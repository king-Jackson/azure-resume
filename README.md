# azure-resume
My Azure resume - following Microsoft's Official documentation for hosting a static website on blob storage.

 The purpose of this resume is to display cybersecurity related projects. As best practice, I will be documenting the developement of the website, however this is not a project intended to display web development skills. 

## Setting up Version Control and Documentation

- Before beginning this project, I wanted to set up an environment to document and control changes made. I am using some basic markdown to document and have created a github repostiory to manage the changes.
- I used github's official documentation to [check for existing ssh keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys), [generate a new ssh key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent), and then [add the ssh key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) to my github account.
- I referenced github docs for [basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for note taking.

## Hosting the website on Azure using blob storage

- I followed Microsoft's tutorial on [hosting a static website on blob storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website-host) in order to get started.
- First I created a storage account, enabled static web hosting, then created and specified the default and error pages.
- Next, I created a photos folder for later use.
- Finally, I added a CSS file in order to provide some styling for later steps of the project.
